# Codveda-Portfolio-Platform

A progressive portfolio and productivity platform built during my 1-month Codveda Technologies internship, evolving from a static site to full-stack authenticated web application.

The project evolves across three levels:

- Level 1: Static portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Level 2: Interactive applications and front-end frameworks
- Level 3: Full-stack application with authentication and database integration

## Internship Goals

- Apply web development fundamentals
- Build scalable and maintainable applications
- Demonstrate real-world engineering workflows using Git and GitHub

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- React
- Node.js & Express
- MongoDB
- JWT Authentication

## Project Structure

Each level is stored in its own folder for clarity and evaluation.
Git branches are used to track the evolution of the application over time.
